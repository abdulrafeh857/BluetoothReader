/**
 Provides standard object for messaging using the React bridge.  Generic classes
 cannot be used or exported with @objc therefore we need the asDictionary function
 in order to control conversion.
 
 This has been tested with <String> but will
 probably need some love in order to get other objects working based on the
 implementation.  If anything changes, it will most likely be the building
 of the dictionary to appropriately convert the data object into a String
 (or other basic React Bridge serializable object)
