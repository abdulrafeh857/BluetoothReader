## Pending changes

## Added

- `isBluetoothAvailable` method used to ensure Bluetooth is a feature on the device.
- `openBluetoothSettings` method for Android devices. This will open Android's Bluetooth Setting's activity.

## [1.60.0-rc8]

## Edited

- `writeToDevice` updated to (maybe) actually work with binary Buffer data.  When providing a buffer the data is not re-wrapped in a string and just base64 encoded for transfer.  This still requires a custom `DeviceConnection` as the default is to send as a String, but at this point it's sending the correct string based on the binary data.

## [1.60.0-rc7]

## Edited

- Issue/84 Resolved issue with missing default connection options on Android (both React and Native)

## [1.60.0-rc6]

## Edited

- Reverted all the sdk 24 version functionality (streams, BiConsumer, etc) to their original.  This will allow correct installation and functionality on minSdk 16 which was requested.
- Resolved issue with `accept()` not returning the device once completed - therefore not letting the client/app know things were good

### Removed

- Removed a number of unused classes, interfaces and enums.
## [1.60.0-rc5]

### Oops

- Completely missed this version, I really need to automate this.
## [1.60.0-rc.4]

### Edited

- Issue/71 Resolved issue **Invalid Connector Type**
## [1.60.0-rc.3]

Initial release
### Added
